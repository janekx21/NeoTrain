[Neo Train](https://neo-train.lamdera.app/) is an online touch typing trainer for the [neo layout](https://www.neo-layout.org/). It is built with [lamdera](https://lamdera.com/), which uses [elm](https://elm-lang.org/). The Page supports the layouts Neo, Bone, NeoQwertz, AdNW, KOY, NeoQwerty, Vou, Mine and Noted. It has randomly generated lectures for each, as well as a couple of handwritten dictations.
